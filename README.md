# Driver-Drowsiness-Detector using Keras & OpenCv

A Deep Learning model which uses the Convolutional Neural Network with OpenCv to detect whether the driver in a vehicle is drowsy or not, trained the model using CNN under different lightning conditions and used openCv along with Haar Cascade Classiﬁer to detect the movements of the eye lids. 

# Data
The closed and open eye images were obatined from the web, performed rigorous data augmentation on the images to increase the number of images under different lightening conditions and angles.

# Environment and Tools

1.Keras

2.Plotly

3.Numpy

4.Pandas

5.OpenCv
